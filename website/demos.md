Here we have gathered links to various interactive demos and visualization tools that CS107E students have found useful in the past. Check them out!

- [Interactive Raspberry Pi GPIO Pinout](https://pinout.xyz/). Nice way to see alternate
  functions by clicking each pin. Also, click Ground and you see all the
  other Ground pins.

- An
[interactive demo of the ARM immediate value encoding](https://alisdair.mcdiarmid.org/arm-immediate-value-encoding/#play-with-it). A tribute to how much can be done with just an 8-bit value and barrel shifter.

- Download [VisUAL](http://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/index.html) and play with it. This visual simulator emulates the ARM instruction set and allows you to step through an assembly program. Pat used this tool in lecture.
    
    _Note: VisUAL uses a [slightly different ARM assembly syntax](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0773a/chr1383143764305.html) from the GNU syntax we use in the course -- for example, you don't put colons after labels in VisUAL._

- Try Matt Godbolt's [Compiler Explorer](http://gcc.godbolt.org/) to enter C code and see the mapping to compiled assembly. 
  
    _Note: Be sure to set the compiler `ARM gcc 5.4.1(none)`, which is close to what we use._

- [cdecl.org](http://cdecl.org/) converts "C gibberish" declarations to and from English.

- Type a C program into [Repl](https://repl.it/languages/c) and it will compile and execute in a virtual environment.
Handy for quickly running a C snippet to see what it does.

- Enter a C program into [C Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=edit) and you can step through and visualize its execution, including showing the contents of the stack and heap memory.
